Files in the project:

* `cats.py`: The typing test logic
* `utils.py`: Utility functions for interacting with files and strings
* `ucb.py`: Utility functions for CS 61A projects
* `data/sample_paragraphs.txt`: A file containing text samples to be typed (scraped Wikipedia articles about various topics)
* `data/common_words.txt`: A file containing common English words in order of frequency
* `data/words.txt`: A file containing many more English words in order of frequency
* `gui.py`: A web server for the web-based graphical user interface (GUI)
* `gui_files`: A directory of files needed for the graphical user interface (GUI)
